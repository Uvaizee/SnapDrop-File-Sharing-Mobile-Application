# PairDrop for Android Privacy Policy  

"PairDrop for Android" is an open-source project designed to provide an easy-to-use, cross-platform file-sharing solution that integrates well with the Androidâ„¢ system.  

Unlike standalone services, our app does not have its own backend or servers. Instead, it relies entirely on web-based services selected by the user within the app (e.g. https://pairdrop.net/ by default). Because of this, the privacy and security of your data depend on the specific website you choose to use. We strongly recommend that users review the privacy policy of the selected web service before using it.  

## Server Connections  

To enable device discovery on your local network, the app connects to the chosen web-based service. For example, if you use https://pairdrop.net/, your public IP address is temporarily processed to create a shared "room" for all devices in the same network. Any information handled by the web service is subject to its own privacy policy.  

## User Rights  

Since we do not operate our own servers or store any user data, we cannot provide options to delete your information. If you want to stop using the app, simply uninstall it from your device. Any files received through the app will remain on your device until you manually delete them.  

## Permissions  

The app requires the following permissions:  

- **Storage Access:** Necessary for sending and receiving files on some Android versions. We do not process your files beyond what is explicitly selected for sharing.  
- **WiFi State Access:** Used only locally to check network conditions and is not transmitted outside your device.
